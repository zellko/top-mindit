The Odin Project - JavaScript - Project: JavaScript Final Project 

üåê Live version: https://mindit-c6a56.web.app/

## Description:

This project was made as part of The Odin Project, full stack javascript Curriculum! 

This is the final project of the JavaScript section. The goal was to replicate one well know website. 

I choose to replicated a kind of mix between Twitter and Reddit. Yeah, may not have been a clever idea. 

I posted, directly on the website, a kind of summary of this project journey. [If you want to check it!](https://mindit-c6a56.web.app/user/Zellkoss)
